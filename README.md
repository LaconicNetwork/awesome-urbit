# awesome-urbit

Resources to help new users orient themselves around - and easily get started with - Urbit. This repository complements the [existing introductory documentation](https://urbit.org/getting-started) but focuses on onboarding users rather than developers. For existing Urbit developers, our Urbit projects are included here. The [urbit/awesome-urbit](https://github.com/urbit/awesome-urbit) repo is a great next step once you have joined the network and are comfortable using it regularly.

## Getting Started

The many existing hosting providers that come with a planet are excellent - but these involve both vague and explicit commitments. We've found this to be a barrier to entry for those wanting to quickly experiment trying out Urbit and existing apps, in a throwaway environment. They also obfuscate what is happening under the hood.

To this end, the following doc explains a repeatable process for deploying comets on Digital Ocean:

- [Deploy an Urbit Comet on Digital Ocean](/docs/comets-on-DO.md)

## Azimuth Watcher

Like most applications that use Ethereum, the Azimuth PKI relies on Infura, a centralized service provider. Laconic created the Azimuth Watcher to contribute towards ongoing decentralization of the Urbit stack. Read along:

## Visualizing Urbit

Urbit introduces a plethora of new terminology; this diagram should help connect dots for the budding Urbit enthusiast. As a user, you have many options for running Urbit, depending on your use case.
